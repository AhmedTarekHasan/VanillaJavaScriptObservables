While working on a side project just for fun, I wanted to write a JavaScript script to call a REST API and eventually do some cool stuff on a webpage. It is purely vanilla JavaScript, with no fancy frameworks or even libraries being used.

First, I thought of using Promises for my calls and this was easy for me. I have done that a ton of times. However, it then hit me hard — why don’t I use Observables? I knew that vanilla JavaScript didn’t natively support Observables. But couldn’t I implement it myself? And that’s what I did.
